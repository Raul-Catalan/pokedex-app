# Pokedex

This project aims to create a front-end design that will call the popular API [pokeapi](pokeapi.co)

## Technologies used

I used nextjs to build the main application with typescript. One of the libraries I really wanted to get experience with was [TanStack Query (FKA React Query)](https://www.tansack.com), and this project aims to utilize most of its functions so I can have deeper understanding of how to use it in my nextjs applications.
